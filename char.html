			<h2>Mario</h2>
			<p>Mario is the primary protagonist of the Super Mario games, his full name is Mario Mario.</p>
			<p>
				Mario has average stats, making him an acceptable choice in all situations. He has no 
				outstanding abilities. Does not have a medical degree despite claims otherwise.
			</p>
			<q>It's a-me, Mario!</q>

			<h2>Luigi</h2>
			<p>Luigi is the secondary protagonist of the Super Mario games, his full name is Luigi Mario.</p>
			<p>
				Luigi has high jump, but he is weaker than average. He is slightly slower than average as 
				well. He holds the highest power level of all the Mario characters, exceeding billions.
			</p>
			<q>That's Mama Luigi to you, Mario!</q>

			<h2>Toad</h2>
			<p>Toad is the most brutal hitman in the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
			<p>
				Toad is the fastest and the strongest. He has the lowest jump in the game, however. Due to his 
				poor jumping ability, he relies heavily on the charged jump.
			</p>
			<q>And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it; and shall desire to die, and death 
			shall flee from them.</q>

			<img class="profileimg" src="img/peach-profile.png" alt="princess peach">
			<h2>Peach</h2>
			<p>Peach is a product of Luigi's illusory unreality, just like all of this.</p>
			<p>
				The princess has a special float jump that allows her to hover in midair, which can be used to 
				jump further or correct an otherwise fatal landing. As a tradeoff, she has the lowest speed 
				and power.
			</p>
			<q>The fate of destruction is also the joy of rebirth.</q>
