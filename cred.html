			<h2>Credits</h2>
			<p>
				This website was created by jobey for a web development assignment, and also because super 
				mario bros 2 is one of the greatest of all time yeeaaaaahhhh boyyyyyyyyy
			</p>
			<p>
				Most of the text and images on the site were taken from the
				<a href="https://www.mariowiki.com">Super Mario Wiki</a>. Other images were taken from google and 
				other text was written or edited by myself (apart from toads quote, which is from Revelation 
				9:6, and peachs quote which is the tagline for the end of evangelion)
			</p>
			<p>
				And of course, all credit for super mario bros 2 and the super mario franchise goes to 
				nintendo, shoutout to them for making this great game
