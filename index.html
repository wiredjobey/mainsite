			<h2>A timeless masterpiece</h2>
			<p>
				Super Mario Bros. 2 (known as Super Mario USA in Japan) is, outside Japan, the second game in 
				the Super Mario series. It is a 2D platforming game originally released for the Nintendo 
				Entertainment System. In the years that followed, it has been ported to many other systems, 
				including a release on the Virtual Console for the Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U. The game was 
				originally released in North America on October 9, 1988. As a result of Japan already having a 
				Super Mario Bros. 2 (known outside of Japan as Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels), the game 
				did not make its debut in the country until after the release of Super Mario World, on July 
				14, 1992, making it Japan's fifth installment of the series. One of the central game mechanics 
				that differentiates Super Mario Bros. 2 from other Super Mario games is that players can 
				select four characters – Mario, Luigi, Toad, or Princess Toadstool – and each of these 
				characters have their unique gameplay mechanics, offering advantages and disadvantages in 
				their stats. Another distinction is that players cannot defeat enemies by stomping on them: 
				players need to either toss items at enemies or pick up and toss enemies at each other to 
				defeat them.

			<h2>The real SMB2?</h2>
			<p>
				Super Mario Bros. 2 came about after Nintendo of America deemed Super Mario Bros.: The Lost 
				Levels too difficult for Western audiences, which led Nintendo to redevelop the Famicom 
				Disk System game Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic into a Super Mario Bros. game for the 
				international release. After its release, the game became a commercial success, and eventually 
				the game became well received enough that it was also released in Japan. After performing well 
				both critically and commercially, Super Mario Bros. 2 has been re-released as one of the Mario 
				games featured in Super Mario All-Stars, and as well as having its own enhanced port in Super 
				Mario Advance. Many enemies first introduced in Super Mario Bros. 2 have become common 
				recurring enemies in the Mario which includes Bob-Ombs, Pokeys, Shyguys, and more, while the 
				gameplay ability of picking up various items and tossing them has been reused in several later 
				games.
